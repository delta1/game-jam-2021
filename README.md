theme is "BUG"

deadline is before December 1 13:37 PT (22:37 SAST)

goals:

"day 1" Nov 3: planning and hacking

- investigate phaser and the assets it ships with (no assets)
- decide on game type and how it should work (thinking of a slashy type platformer)
- find some placeholder assets (https://itch.io/game-assets/free?page=2)
- music?: https://tallbeard.itch.io/music-loop-bundle
- started with https://github.com/brannonh/phaser3-typescript-project-template
- migrate JS bundling to esbuild, so much faster
- set up deploy to netlify
